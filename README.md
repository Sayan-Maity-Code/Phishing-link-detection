## Malicious URL Detection Model
This repository contains code for a machine learning model designed to detect malicious URLs. The model is implemented using Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and joblib.

## How it Works
The model uses machine learning algorithms such as Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression to classify URLs as either malicious or benign. It utilizes features extracted from URLs using techniques like tokenization and TF-IDF vectorization. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled URLs, where each URL is associated with a binary label indicating whether it is malicious or not.

## Usage
Training the Model: Users can train the model using the provided script. The dataset containing labeled URLs is loaded, preprocessed, and split into training and testing sets. The model is then trained using different vectorization techniques and machine learning algorithms.

Testing the Model: After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate testing dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are generated to assess the model's effectiveness in detecting malicious URLs.

Real-time Prediction: Users can input a URL to the trained model for real-time prediction of its maliciousness. The model processes the URL using the same vectorization techniques used during training and provides a prediction based on its learned patterns.
## Screenshots
